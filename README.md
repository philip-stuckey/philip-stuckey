Hello, My name is [Philip Stuckey](https://www.github.com/philip-stuckey), I am a data scientist scientist with a background (read *bachelors degree*) in physics and a passion for programming. 

My favorite programming language is julia, but I'm looking for an excuse to learn rust. 
I'm currently working with some friends on [A very early development game](https://github.com/Ribby95/Political_War_Game/) just for fun.
