Hello, My name is [Philip Stuckey], I am a data scientist with a background (read *bachelors degree*) in physics and a passion for programming. 

My favorite programming language is julia, but I'm looking for an excuse to learn rust. 
I'm currently working with some friends on [A very early development game][wargame] just for fun.
