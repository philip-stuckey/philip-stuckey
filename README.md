  Using Reinforcement learning to get into orbit in Kerbal Space Program.
- [Checkers.jl](https://github.com/philip-stuckey/Checkers.jl):
  Brute force method for finding the minimum dominating set for grid-like graphs (i.e. how do I cover a checkerboard such that each square is next to a checker, but with the fewest checkers)
