Hello, My name is [Philip Stuckey](https://www.github.com/philip-stuckey), I am a data scientist scientist with a background (read Bachelors degree) in physics and a passion for programming. 

My favorite programming language is julia, but I'm looking for an excuse to learn rust. 
My current focus is on [OrbitalMechanics.jl](https://github.com/philip-stuckey/OrbitalMechanics.jl),
my (poorly named) project to use machine learning to get into orbit in Kerbal Space Program.
